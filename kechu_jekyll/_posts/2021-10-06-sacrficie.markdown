## Provenance
Anyang, Henan, China

## Background
The earliest attested written records in China are known as the "oracle bone inscriptions" from the period of the Shang dynasty (ca. 1250-1046 BC). Around  50,000 pieces of inscribed oracle bones and several dozen short bronze-vessel inscriptions were found around the Great Settlement Shang in the site of Yinxu, Anyang (Keightley 1997).

The Great Settlement Shang is ruled by kings. Since Shang divinity is not entirely benevolent, sacrifices of both humans and animals are frequently made to the ancestors and spirits of the land on behalf of the king to mitigate uncertainty and secure their blessings. We are concerned with the nature of Shang divinity: what is the relationship between natural spirits and ancestors? Are natural spirits fundamentally different from ancestors or there are overlaps between them?
