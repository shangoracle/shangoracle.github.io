## Introduction
Successful campaigns in the Shang context ended with the sacrifice of captives. And the vast majority of inscriptions regarding human sacrifice appear to follow the logic that of reduction from political enemy to anonymous victim (Campbell 2018, 202). In this post, we would use the examples of *Qiang*-captives to get a glimpse into whether natural spirits and ancestors both receive human sacrifice: why some case make offering to natural gods while other times to ancestors?
